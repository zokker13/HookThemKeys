# HookThemKeys

This repository allows people to capture mouse and keyboard strokes and replace them with different once.
The target key output will be redirected into a SC2 process so that no other process is affected.

## How is it done?
You can hook LowLevel Mouse and Keyboard events from csharp easily.

## Cheating!?
It's only allowed to replace one key with another key so it's basically the same thing as any modern mouse/keyboard driver.
